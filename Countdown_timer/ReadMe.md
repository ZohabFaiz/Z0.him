# Countdown Timer ⏳

Hello! This is **Zohab Faiz**, and this is my very first Python project — a simple yet functional **countdown timer**.

I’ve explained each line of the code in `Countdown_timer.py`, including all the libraries and functions used.  
This is a beginner-friendly project, perfect for anyone learning Python basics.
